Love restaurants with good food and great  wine ists that does not attempt to break my bank. 

I believe in making new friends and keeping old ones.
Food should be a conversation point, enjoyable and certainly not to be used to exclude others.  If it does, its not food but a social ladder, it gives me vertigo.
If you put me in a box, I will round it up into an expanding circle because a person does not  express themselves in one way only and everybody has a complex side

I love Nature, Dogs and Coffee, not necessarily in that order
I respect all people, all races and all types of natures, after all that is why we are here to explore and enjoy this beautiful earth that is at our disposal.

I avoid disrespectful people, I believe somewhere in life they lost their ability to hear others and learnt to hear only themselves.  will give them an option to an even exchange after which I do not believe community beneficial for both of us.

I love to laugh at myself, it stops me from taking myself too seriously and believing that I am better than everybody.  There is always better or lesser than me.  Thats just different nothing to crow about or en depressed about.

We are a professional couple that lives in NYC/ Woodstock most of the time.  We are in the film business, so we travel quite a lot, and love our homes that we are offering here ~

About us?  We enjoy anything outdoors.  Running, hiking, skiing, biking, etc.  And whether you want to be near the city or in the country, both of our homes are completely suited for comfort and peacefulness ~

The Hoboken House is perfect for families or larger groups that want to visit the city, but want a chill place to retreat in the evenings.  It offers an 'upstairs/ downstairs' living option.  Downstairs / the private outdoor lawn / patio provide for refined entertaining or a casual BBQ.

The Streamside Cottage in famous Woodstock offers a 'writers retreat' or 'ski chalet' experience in the Catskill Mountains. The land is a real vortex of good energy and amazing wildlife.  We've been featured in ""Better Homes & Gardens"", too.

Paulusen operated a ferry boat and traded with the Lenepe people in the area, and is responsible for its name {Paulus Hook comes from the anglicization of Paulusen’s last name, with the “hook” designation describing the small island area seen at high tide in the early 1600s}. Through the late 1700s, Paulus Hook continued to thrive off a busy ferry service that spanned the mile journey along the water to New York City, while the Battle of Paulus Hook took place in 1779, and marked an advantageous battle for the United States during the Revolutionary War.

Paulusen operated a ferry boat and traded with the Lenepe people in the area, and is responsible for its name {Paulus Hook comes from the anglicization of Paulusen’s last name, with the “hook” designation describing the small island area seen at high tide in the early 1600s}. Through the late 1700s, Paulus Hook continued to thrive off a busy ferry service that spanned the mile journey along the water to New York City, while the Battle of Paulus Hook took place in 1779, and marked an advantageous battle for the United States during the Revolutionary War.

As a traveler, I have visited and backpacked through many different countries on a shoestring.  My experiences have been awesome.  

My goal is to enable others to be able to do the same.

Foremost, thanks for taking the time out to review my listings and learn more about me.

My name is Nassly.  I have lived in NJ most of my life.   I love traveling, especially on a budget and understand the importance of having a safe and clean space to lay one's head.

I have been a host and a guest. 

As a host, I am opening my own home to  provide clean, comfortable, and budget friendly rooms in a HUMBLE home-like atmosphere.   Staying with us, is like staying at a distant family member's home.  I take pride and put much effort (elbow grease) in cleaning, maintaining, and SLOWLY upgrading my listings.  I do NOT provide luxury hotel accommodations.  If that is what you are seeking, please book at the Ritz & pay hotel prices to do so.  I do not have professional staff or offer butler service.  My home, like most bodies, has stretch marks, creaks, and minor dents.  It also has wear and tear from hosting and age. 

I am extremely honest in my listing descriptions. Please read them.

Foremost, thanks for taking the time out to review my listings and learn more about me.

My name is Nassly.  I have lived in NJ most of my life.   I love traveling, especially on a budget and understand the importance of having a safe and clean space to lay one's head.

I have been a host and a guest. 

As a host, I am opening my own home to  provide clean, comfortable, and budget friendly rooms in a HUMBLE home-like atmosphere.   Staying with us, is like staying at a distant family member's home.  I take pride and put much effort (elbow grease) in cleaning, maintaining, and SLOWLY upgrading my listings.  I do NOT provide luxury hotel accommodations.  If that is what you are seeking, please book at the Ritz & pay hotel prices to do so.  I do not have professional staff or offer butler service.  My home, like most bodies, has stretch marks, creaks, and minor dents.  It also has wear and tear from hosting and age. 

I am extremely honest in my listing descriptions. Please read them.

As a traveler, I have visited and backpacked through many different countries on a shoestring.  My experiences have been awesome.  

My goal is to enable others to be able to do the same. 

 Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns during your stay or prior to.   

*******Please Note******************

For safety of my guests, my home, and myself, I provide full disclosure of myself and expect same from my guests.  

I require an accurate and clear profile picture & completed registration on  Airbnb profile, including uploading your government ID prior to check-in.  If not, your reservation will not be accepted or you will be cancelled.  Thank you for your understanding.

I have been a host and a guest. 

As a host, I am opening my own home to  provide clean, comfortable, and budget friendly rooms in a HUMBLE home-like atmosphere.   Staying with us, is like staying at a distant family member's home.

If that is what you are seeking, please book at the Ritz & pay hotel prices to do so.  I do not have professional staff or offer butler service.  My home, like most bodies, has stretch marks, creaks, and minor dents.  It also has wear and tear from hosting and age. 

I am extremely honest in my listing descriptions. Please read them.

As a traveler, I have visited and backpacked through many different countries on a shoestring.  My experiences have been awesome.

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in NYC.

I am self-employed, working in building my own business online as I do part time in hospitality and go to school in NYC. I go to my house, two or three times a week sometimes more to clean or get creative in the basement as I enjoy painting and gardening.
I  make sure the house is clean and always looks presentable. I have great neighborhood and my house is super comfy and quiet. I would love to host you and make sure you have an enjoyable comfortable and most importantly clean stay. Ask me any question you may have in mind. I love helping by providing the best recommendations around the city, best restaurants and things to do in the area.
I am pretty laid back, I enjoy running (and cooking), gardening, socializing, traveling. I also like to keep a very clean house and respect the environment.

Foremost, thanks for taking the time out to review my listings and learn more about me.

My name is Nassly.  I have lived in NJ most of my life.   I love traveling, especially on a budget and understand the importance of having a safe and clean space to lay one's head.

I have been a host and a guest. 

As a host, I am opening my own home to  provide clean, comfortable, and budget friendly rooms in a HUMBLE home-like atmosphere.   Staying with us, is like staying at a distant family member's home.  I take pride and put much effort (elbow grease) in cleaning, maintaining, and SLOWLY upgrading my listings.  I do NOT provide luxury hotel accommodations.  If that is what you are seeking, please book at the Ritz & pay hotel prices to do so.  I do not have professional staff or offer butler service.  My home, like most bodies, has stretch marks, creaks, and minor dents.  It also has wear and tear from hosting and age. 

I am extremely honest in my listing descriptions. Please read them.

As a traveler, I have visited and backpacked through many different countries on a shoestring.  My experiences have been awesome.  

My goal is to enable others to be able to do the same. 

 Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns during your stay or prior to.   

*******Please Note******************

For safety of my guests, my home, and myself, I provide full disclosure of myself and expect same from my guests.  

I require an accurate and clear profile picture & completed registration on  Airbnb profile, including uploading your government ID prior to check-in.  If not, your reservation will not be accepted or you will be cancelled.  Thank you for your understanding.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to university in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. 

I work freelance in tech, and in my spare time I enjoy walking in the park by my apartment, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My boyfriend Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in NYC.

I have lived in the NYC area for 8 years, and have been sharing my space (now spaces!) with guests since 2014. I love hosting!

I grew up in Houston, Texas, went to university in Pennsylvania, and spent time living in Italy, Spain, and Australia before moving to NYC. 

I work freelance in tech, and in my spare time I enjoy walking in the park by my apartment, wandering around NYC, all the self-care (massages, facials, yoga), and eating out (plus a good cocktail) with friends. 

I'm an avid traveler and have stayed with friends all over the world. I love to get a local experience when I travel, so I'm happy to provide that for my guests. My boyfriend Mario and I host together, so you may hear or see him as well! 

Any and all questions welcome! I want to make sure you have a great time in NYC.
